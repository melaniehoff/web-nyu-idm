### What are 5 words that come to mind when thinking about this object?

### Are there spatial places this object is associated with for me?

### What does my object look like?

### Feel like? Is there texture here? Can I run my fingers across it or through it? Does it stick to me?

### Sound like? What sounds do you associate with this object? The voice of someone you know? A song?

### Smell like? If your object doesn't have a smell, what would your object be if it WERE a smell?

### Where did you get it? Was it a gift? How did it come to be yours?

### What are the emotions attached to this object for you? If there are many emotions here, describe how they intersect with each other. Is there a narrative to the order of these emotions?

### Why did you choose it? Of all the objects you could have brought, why this one? Is there a story you want to tell?

### What do you see in your object that no one else would see?

### Is it one of a kind? If there are there many others like it, what experiences has your object had that none of the look-a-likes would have had?

### How do you interact with it? Do you hold it? do you squeeze it? Do you go flip through it's layers? Do you open it's door? Do you hold it differently in different situations? Do you communicate with it?

### What are some other objects it does or might have relationships with. In an imagined world of this object, who are it's friends and neighbors?

### What is a small & specific, memory you have with this object?





We will create websites that draw from our responses to the Object Meditation Questions.
Your website is not a literal representation of your object but is evocative of the emotions, textures, histories, or other qualities of your object. 
your object meditation website will have multiple sections or viewa and tell a story or be an expression of poetry.
